### Overview

The 151 Challenge is very simple... You must complete the game by only battling with Gen 1 Pokemon. You'll need to know each Route on your journey to becoming the champion... wild Pokemon encounters vary depending on the version. Unlike the Nuzlocke Challenge, the 151 Challenge is designed to be fun and narrative focused. It makes you think about the Johto region in a different way as you assemble your team of Gen 1 companions!

### The Rules

1. You may only battle with your Gen 2 starter in your first encounter with your rival. This encounter cannot be avoided
  
2. When you receive a Poke Ball from Elm's assistant, you must catch a Gen 1 Pokemon in any grassy area before Cherrygrove town (the first town with a Pokemon Center). Store your Gen 2 starter in the PC in Cherrygrove and proceed with your new Gen 1 companion
  
3. You may only battle or use HM moves with Gen 1 Pokemon thereafter. You may catch Gen 2 Pokemon but they cannot be part of your team
  
4. Any Gen 1 Pokemon you catch you must keep and train as your companion. You should not catch a Gen 1 Pokemon only to exploit their HM compatibility
  
5. Once you have 6 Gen 1 Pokemon in your team, you may store one of them in the PC to accommodate any new Pokemon that are caught later in the game
  
### Notes

- You may not be able to use your Gen 2 starter but your choice will determine the Type of your rival's starter Pokemon, so keep that in mind
  
- When you receive a Poke Ball from Elm's assistant, you will need to explore Route 29 and Route 46 to find your new Gen 1 proxy starter Pokemon
  
- Check out the Bulbapedia entry for each Route to learn more about which Gen 1 Pokemon you're likely to encounter (which may vary depending on the time of day)
